# Cyberbullying_Detection_project
This project is a Flask-based web application that detects cyberbullying in text using multiple pre-trained machine learning models. It helps identify harmful online behavior and promote a safer digital environment.
FEATURES: Predict whether a given text is cyberbullying or not.
          Uses various ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, etc.).
          Web interface built with Flask.
          Trained on a labeled dataset of social media comments.

MODELS USED: Logistic Regression
             LinearSVC (with tuned version)
             Multinomial Naive Bayes
             Decision Tree Classifier
             AdaBoost & Bagging Classifiers
